## Introduction


## Approaches

- Descriptive
- Time Series
- Longitudinal Data
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Descriptive

- Compare average behavior times
- Make two classes: 
    1. days with reported incidence
    2. days without reported incidence
    

## Boxplot


## Time Series (TS)

- __Definition__: Single set of data whose observations are ordered in time. 
- Observations on the same quantity $\rightarrow$ correlated and not independent
- Examples ...


## TS Models

- AR: Auto-regressive
- MA: Moving average
- ARMA: combine AR and MA
- ARIMA: allows for non-stationary trends

## Longitudinal Data


## Support Vector Machine (SVM)
